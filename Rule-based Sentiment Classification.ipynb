%0.2f): what an embarrassment . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly

neg %0.2f): at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press\n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind

likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f):  . . . post-september 11 , \" the sum of all fears \" seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence

fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): return to never

there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of \" plastic-like \" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i treat the battery well and it has lasted . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone \" unlike the nokia 3650 \" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): anything this phone does , it does perfectly . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): overall , i highly recommend this phone . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i like the size and weight of this little critter . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): - light , compact design \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): - solid , high-quality construction \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): - bright , visible screen \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i like the speakphone function a lot . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i like the automatic key lock function . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the phone is very light weight . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i am enjoying my phone a lot .... \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): this is the best phone i have seen . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the battery life is amazing . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): great features .. . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): great screen and great sound . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): but , i would definately recommend this phone . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): - no propietary headset jack \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): its quiet . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . \n","ERROR (pos classed as neg %0.2f): the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . \n","ERROR (neg classed as pos %0.2f): when talking the voice is not very clear . \n","Sigma: 2.22\n","Threshold: -25.15\n","Mean score: -43.222627737226276\n","Accuracy (All)=0.62
